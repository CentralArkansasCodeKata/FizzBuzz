FizzBuzz
=============

FizzBuzz is a pretty well known coding interview question which will require some knowledge about loops and a little logic to solve.  This problem will likely take you no time at all to solve especially if you are an expereinced software craftsman.  So as an added challenge, solve it in a language you are not very familar with and do not code in every day.  Remember the goal of code kata is to level up our programming skills!

### Task
Your task is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

###Input
None.

###Output
Output the numbers 1 through 100.
* If the number is not a multiple of 3 or 5 print the number.
* If the number is a multiple of 3 print "Fizz."
* If the number is a multiple of 5 print "Buzz."
* If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz."
